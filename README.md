# TokenURI

The tokenURI on an NFT is a unique identifier of what the token "looks" like. A URI could be an API call over HTTPS, an IPFS hash, or anything else unique.
These show what an NFT looks like, and its attributes. The image section points to another URI of what the NFT looks like. This makes it easy for NFT platforms like Opensea, Rarible, and Mintable to render NFTs on their platforms, since they are all looking for this metadata.

# IPFS

IPFS is a peer to peer network in a decentralised manner where we can store data

# \_safeMint(owner,Id)

owner->the one who initially hit that create collectible function
Id->the item id

# \_setTokenURI(item,tokenURI)
